# Tuitter

> A Twitter redesign ...

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

The program is a friendly Twitter redesign that allows for a simple login using the username. Users sign up with their fullname and a username and optionally a profile picture. The page then opens to a dashboard where they can view all 'tueets' and compose new 'tueets'. They can also also see the list of users that they can follow and can access their profiles and others profiles to view or to send tagged tueets. Enjoy!
